*****************************************
Reporting Contravention of the DPR events
*****************************************

===============
1. Introduction
===============

The Online Event Reporting System (OERS) was created to allow companies
to report regulatory events directly to the Canada Energy Regulator
(CER). OERS is part of a larger system called the Operations Regulatory
Compliance Application (ORCA) which also allows companies to review
their compliance verification activity reports, submit and view the
status of condition filings and interact with CER staff.

In this manual you will find instructions and guidance on how to use
OERS to report Contravention of Damage Prevention Regulations -
Authorizations (DPR-A) events, Damage to Pipe events, and the
information required by the system.

For more information on other types of events required to be reported
and for additional guidance on those Event Types (e.g. Incident
reporting), please see the `*CER Event Reporting
Guidelines* <https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/bts/ctrg/gnnb/rprtnggdlns/index-eng.html>`__
or the `*CER Remediation Process
Guide* <https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/sftnvrnmnt/nvrnmnt/rmdtnprcssgd/index-eng.html>`__.

2. Send a Message to the CER
============================

If you have technical questions related to a reported regulatory event,
or would like to request your report be retracted (see section 5.1.2
below), please use the **“Send a Message”** function in left-hand menu
of the OERS system. This will automatically direct your inquiry to the
CER staff assigned to your file.

If you have system issues that prevent you from using this message
button, or a general inquiry that is not related to a reported event,
you can email
`DLERSSupport@cer-rec.gc.ca <mailto:DLERSSupport@neb-one.gc.ca>`__. This
is a monitored email box and CER staff will respond within one business
day.

3. Reportable Contraventions of DPR-A and Damage to Pipe
========================================================

Information defining events reportable to the CER can be found in the
`*CER Event Reporting
Guidelines* <https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/bts/ctrg/gnnb/rprtnggdlns/index-eng.html>`__.

4 How to create a new event and submit an INITIAL REPORT
========================================================

The first step to reporting involves creating a new Contravention of
DPR-A and/or Damage to Pipe event in OERS. Section 4 of this guide will
show you how to create a new Contravention of DPR-A and/or Damage to
Pipe event in OERS, and all steps up to and including the submission of
your Initial Report to the CER.

4.1 Access OERS
---------------

To create a new event, access the OERS as follows:

1. Access the OERS online using the following URL:
   https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/ers

2. A “Welcome” screen will appear as shown below.

3. After reviewing the information in the “Welcome” screen, click
   Continue to proceed with creating a new event.

   |image0|

4.2 Contact Information
-----------------------

Enter the following information in the “Contact” screen shown below.
Mandatory fields are denoted by a red asterisk.

The minimum information required is your first name, last name, work
phone number, and email address. Check the reCAPTCHA box to confirm you
are not a robot, then click **Save and Next** at the bottom of the page.

|image1|

4.3 Email Confirmation
----------------------

After entering your information as described in section 4.2, the “Email
Confirmation” screen shown below will appear and a confirmation message
will automatically be sent to the email address provided. If the email
message does not appear in your email inbox, check your junk email
folder.

A unique link to your new event in the OERS will be included in the body
of the confirmation email. Click the link to be redirected to your event
in OERS. Additional information can then be entered to submit the event
to the CER. If you are not redirected to the OERS after clicking the
link in the email, please contact the CER at DLERSSupport@cer-rec.gc.ca
for assistance.

|image2|

4.4 Event Types
---------------

Once you have clicked on the email link and have been redirected to the
OERS, the “\ **Event Types**\ ” screen will appear as shown below.

|image3|

1. ***Is this an exercise?***

    Confirm whether the event you are reporting is an exercise
    (**Yes/No**).

    | Select **Yes** if you are reporting an exercise.
    | Select **No** if you are providing notification of an actual
      Contravention of DPR-A and/or Damage to Pipe.

1. Under the **Damage Prevention Regulations** heading, select the
   **Event Types** you want to report. Contraventions of DPR-A are
   commonly referred to as unauthorized activities. Select the Event
   Type(s) that best correlate with the activity/activities that caused
   the Contravention of DPR-A.

    If you are reporting Damage to Pipe that is unrelated to a
    Contravention of DPR-A (e.g. historical damage), select “Damage to
    Pipe” as the Event Type.

    Event Types within the **Damage Prevention Regulations** category
    are:

-  Vehicle Crossing;

-  Ground Disturbance;

-  Construction of a Facility; and

-  Damage to Pipe.

**4.4.1 Multiple Event Types **
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible that a single activity may be associated with multiple
Event Types. If multiple Event Types occur as a result of a single
activity, pipeline companies are expected to report the multiple Event
Types within one report by **selecting all Event Types that apply**. See
the following examples:

4.4.1.1 Example 1: Fencing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Excavation (activity) that caused a ground disturbance in contravention
of DPR-A (Event Type: Ground Disturbance), and a fence post was
installed into the hole on the right-of-way without written consent
(Event Type: Construction of a Facility).

In this example, select **two** Event Types: **Ground Disturbance, and
Construction of a Facility** as shown below

|image4|

4.4.1.2 Example 2: Excavation that Damaged a Pipe
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Excavation (activity) that caused a ground disturbance in contravention
of DPR-A (Event Type: Ground Disturbance), and which caused damage to a
pipe (Event Type: Damage to Pipe).

In this example, select **two** Event Types\ **: Ground Disturbance, and
Damage to Pipe,** as shown below.

|image5|

4.4.1.3 Example 3: Landscaping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Landscaping (activity) during which a skid-steer was driven across the
pipeline right-of-way without written consent (Event Type: Vehicle
Crossing), earth cover was removed from the pipeline right-of-way (Event
Type: Ground Disturbance), and a concrete patio was poured over the
pipeline right-of-way without written consent (Event Type: Construction
of a Facility).

In this example, select **three** Event Types: **Vehicle Crossing,
Ground Disturbance, and Construction of a Facility,** as shown below.

|image6|

After you have selected the applicable Event Type(s), click on **Save
and Next** at the bottom of the page to proceed to the next screen.

The first three questions of every **Initial Report** for Contravention
of DPR-A and/or Damage to Pipe are regarding precautionary reporting and
whether the pipe was contacted and/or damaged, as shown below.

|image9|

4.6.1 Is this a precautionary report?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CER has directed companies to take a precautionary approach to
reporting. As a result, the CER is aware that companies will be
reporting a suspected event prior to confirming the final details.
Companies can toggle the “Is this a Precautionary Report” field to
**Yes** to indicate that they are reporting from a precautionary
standpoint. For more information on precautionary reporting please see
the *`CER Event Reporting
Guidelines <https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/bts/ctrg/gnnb/rprtnggdlns/index-eng.html>`__.*

Was the pipe contacted?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the drop-down menu, select **Yes**, **No**, or **Undetermined**.

|image10|

If contact is suspected but **undetermined** within the immediately
reportable timeframe of 24 hours after discovery of the event and there
is no associated contravention of DPR-A being reported, use the
drop-down menu as described in section 4.6.1 above, toggle the “Is this
a Precautionary Report?” field to **Yes** to indicate to the CER that
you are reporting from a precautionary standpoint. You will have the
opportunity to explain the situation and its circumstances on the

   continue to add information on the remaining pages.

2. If you are not ready to complete your Final Report right now, use the
   link you received within the Initial Report confirmation email from
   CER to access OERS at a later time. The timeline for submitting a
   final report for an event can be found in section 7.4 of the CER’s
   Event Reporting Guidelines.

5. How to submit a FINAL REPORT
===============================

Section 5 of this guide will show you how to complete the second step
(**Final Submission**) of reporting Contravention of DPR-A and/or Damage
to Pipe events in OERS. **All pages located below “Initial Submission”
in the left-hand menu are part of the Final Submission**.

5.1 Review the Event Type(s) being reported
-------------------------------------------

In the left-hand menu, pages that are displayed between “Initial
Submission” and “Parties Involved” were generated based on the specific
Event Types you selected in your Initial Report. Each of these pages
will contain questions specific to the Event Types being reported.

In the example shown below, the Event Types selected in the Initial
Report were **Vehicle Crossing**, **Ground Disturbance**, **Construction
of a Facility**, and **Damage to Pipe**. Therefore, each of these Event
Types is now displaying a page in the left-hand menu (see small blue
arrows below).

|image41|

Review the Event Types being reported to confirm the pages being
displayed in the left-hand menu between “Initial Submission” and
“Parties Involved” reflect the Event Types applicable to your **Final
Submission**.

5.1.1 Add or Remove an Event Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As new information becomes available after the submission of an Initial
Report, additional Contravention of DPR-A and/or Damage to Pipe Event
Types may need to be added or removed from the **Final Submission**. To
**add or remove** Event Types:

1. Click on the **Event** **Types** page in the left-hand menu (see blue
   arrow above). This will return you to the Event Types page.

2. Add or remove **Event Types** that are applicable to your **Final
   Submission**. See section 4.4 above for information on how to

   the change in the Event Type (see section 4.5 above for information
   on how to navigate the Company screen). When you are finished the
   Company screen, **click Save and Next** at the bottom of the page.

2. The **Event Type** pages in the left-hand menu will be automatically
   updated based on your selections at step 2 above.

3. You will then be required to re-validate the information on the
   Circumstances page. When you are finished the Circumstances screen,
   **click Save and Next** at the bottom of the Circumstances page.

5.1.2 No reportable events – Request the entire report be retracted
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As described in section 5.1, the left-hand menu between “Initial
Submission” and “Parties Involved” will display pages that were
generated based on the specific Event Types you selected in your Initial
Report, and any Event Types you have just added per section 5.1.1 above.
Each of these pages will contain questions specific to the Event Types
being reported.

As new information becomes available after the submission of an Initial
Report, the pipeline company may determine that no Contravention of
DPR-A and/or Damage to Pipe occurred, such that the entire report needs
to be retracted. Examples include, but are not limited to:

-  Upon further assessment, the pipeline company confirmed the
   construction of a facility did not occur on, along, across, or under
   the pipeline right-of-way.

-  Upon further assessment, the pipeline company confirmed a ground
   disturbance was less than 30 cm deep and did not result in a
   reduction of the amount of earth cover over the pipeline.

-  A Precautionary Initial Report of Damage to Pipe was submitted and
   upon further assessment, the pipeline company confirmed the pipe was
   not damaged.

**A request to retract the entire report must be submitted to the CER
via the ‘Send a Message to the CER’ function in OERS.** See section 2 of
this guide for information on how to Send a Message to the CER via OERS.
