<div class="line">The Online Event Reporting System (OERS) was created to allow
companies to report events</div>
<div class="line">directly to the Canada Energy Regulator (CER). In this manual you will
find instructions on how to use OERS to report environmental
contamination through a Notice of Contamination (NOC), submit
documentation such as a remedial action plan (RAP), closure report and
annual update and communicate with the CER environmental analyst
assigned to the remediation (REM) event.</div>
</div>
<p>For information on other types of events required to be reported and for
additional guidance on those event types (e.g., Incident reporting),
please see the <em>Canada Energy Regulator Event Reporting Guidelines</em>

<p>If you have technical questions related to a specific REM event you have
already reported in OERS, please go to the event using the link sent by
the system and use the “Send a Message to the CER” function. This will direct
your inquiry to the CER Environmental Analyst assigned to your REM event.</p>
<p>If you are having trouble submitting a NOC or you cannot find the information you
need in this manual, please email <a class="reference external" href="mailto:DLERSSupport&#37;&#52;&#48;cer-rec&#46;gc&#46;ca">DLERSSupport<span>&#64;</span>cer-rec<span>&#46;</span>gc<span>&#46;</span>ca</a>. CER staff
