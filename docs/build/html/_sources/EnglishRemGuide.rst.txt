Reporting Remediation Events
============================

1. Introduction
-----------------------------

| The Online Event Reporting System (OERS) was created to allow
  companies to report events
| directly to the Canada Energy Regulator (CER). In this manual you will
  find instructions on how to use OERS to report environmental
  contamination through a Notice of Contamination (NOC), submit
  documentation such as a remedial action plan (RAP), closure report and
  annual update and communicate with the CER environmental analyst
  assigned to the remediation (REM) event.

For information on other types of events required to be reported and for
additional guidance on those event types (e.g., Incident reporting),
please see the *Canada Energy Regulator Event Reporting Guidelines*
(https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/bts/ctrg/gnnb/rprtnggdlns/index-eng.html) or
the *CER Remediation Process Guide*
(https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/sftnvrnmnt/nvrnmnt/rmdtnprcssgd/index-eng.html).

2. Contact Us
-----------------------------

If you have technical questions related to a specific REM event you have
already reported in OERS, please go to the event using the link sent by
the system and use the "Send a Message to the CER" function. This will direct
your inquiry to the CER Environmental Analyst assigned to your REM event.

If you are having trouble submitting a NOC or you cannot find the information you
need in this manual, please email DLERSSupport@cer-rec.gc.ca. CER staff
will respond within 1 business day.

4. Notice of Contamination Submission
--------------------------------------

4.1 Getting Started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OERS is located at the following web address:
https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/ers.

To report a new event, click the Continue button at the bottom of the
welcome page. You will be asked to provide some pertinent information,
including an email address. The email address will be used to allow the
system to send you a link to access the full OERS portal. Once complete,
click “Save and Next”.

|image0|

***Email Confirmation***

| A message with the link to the OERS portal will be sent to the email
  address that you provided. If the
| message does not appear in your Inbox, please check to see if it was
  automatically moved into your Junk
| E-Mail or another folder.

| Click the link in the email confirmation to access the OERS portal,
  where you will be
| asked to enter further data.

4.2 Navigating in OERS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  To access your OERS event, use the email link provided.

-  To navigate through OERS, use the “Next” and “Save to Next” buttons
   on the bottom of each page. The pages follow a logical sequence to
   enter all of the information needed in your report.

-  | OERS requires certain pieces of data, if that data has not been
     included it will display an error
   | message and outline what needs to be corrected.

4.3 Reporting Specific Event Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first screen you will see allows you to select the event types you
want to report. Find “Notice of Contamination” under “Notification –
Remediation.”

|image1|

**Note:** The identification of residual contamination in a Detailed
Incident Report (DIR) will automatically generate a link to a NOC
submission. The NOC should be filled out within five days of receiving
the link. This link will be sent to the contact that completed the DIR.

4.4 Company
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The next screen asks about the company responsible for the particular
pipeline on which the NOC occurred.

| When done entering company information, click “Save and Next” using
  the workflow buttons at the
| bottom of the page.

| |image2|

4.5 Contacts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The contacts screen will display the contact information entered in the
initial contact page. Additional contacts may be entered on this screen
by selecting “Add Contact.” Contact information can be modified by
clicking “Edit” to the right of the contact.

|image3|

4.6 Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The location page is required for all events. It allows companies
  to report details of the location to the CER.

|image4|

|image6|

***Key Things to Know About the Location Page***

1. | Either a pipeline or a facility must be identified on the location
     page. If you cannot find the
   | information you are looking for, you can select “Not Listed” and
     enter the name, diameter, length and commodity carried for
     pipelines and/or enter the name, facility type, latitude, and
     longitude for facilities. The CER will then reconcile the
     information with its databases.

|image7|

1. For “What is the populated centre nearest to the contaminated site?”
   please only enter the name of the hamlet, village, town etc. Do not
   enter the province.

|image8|

1. GPS coordinates are mandatory for contaminated sites. The “View
   Location in Google Maps” function will only work if you have entered
   GPS coordinates into the system.

|image9|

    | If you have selected a facility, the system will auto‐populate the
      GPS coordinates with the
    | information the CER has on file. If you notice this information is
      incorrect, please contact the
    | CER at remediation@cer-rec.gc.ca.

1. Use the definitions below as guidance to assist in selecting the
   appropriate land use category.

|image10|

a. Agricultural Land

i.  | Lands which are either currently cultivated or show signs of
      recent cultivation
    | (i.e., within the past 5 years); or

ii. | Lands which have not been recently cultivated (i.e., within the
      past 5 years), and
    | where sod has developed or is beginning to develop and which is
      used for
    | animal grazing or other agricultural purposes.

b. Protected Area

    | Lands with protective designations, as identified in government
      regulation, and for which development is not permitted or is
      limited. These could include, but are not limited to:
    | national, provincial and regional parks; federal and provincial
      lands with protective
    | designations (e.g., wildlife preserves, ecological reserves); and
      designated Critical Habitat for
    | species on Schedule 1 of *the Species at Risk Act.*

    c. Non‐Developed Land

    | Lands which remain in a relatively natural state. These could
      include, but are not limited to
    | native prairie and forest land. If the land use falls into both
      the Protected Area and Non‐
    | developed Land categories, select ‘Protected Area’.

    d. Developed Land – Industrial

    | Lands where the primary activity involves the production,
      manufacture, or construction of
    | goods.

    e. Developed Land – Small Commercial

    Lands where the primary activity involves commercial businesses and
    not residential or manufacturing.

    f. Developed Land – Residential

    Lands where the primary activity involves residential housing and
    activities.

4.7 Initial Report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This page directs users to input information about the
contamination. If third party contamination is being reported, include
‘Third Party Contamination’ in the one-sentence description.

|image11|

|image12|

***Key Things to Know About the Initial Report Page***

  | The one sentence description of the site should include the major
     contaminant and a few words
   | that describe the location. For example, ‘Hydrocarbon contamination
     at XYZ compressor
   | station’ or, for a facility, ‘Amine contamination next to the XX
     utilities building in the SW corner
   | of the fenced yard’.

    |image13|

1. | The date the contamination was first discovered is the date upon
     which the potential for
   | contamination was first discovered. The date the contamination was
     confirmed is the date
   | upon which laboratory analytical results confirming contamination
     above applicable criteria were received by the company, or a third
     party working on behalf of the company.

|image14|

1. Use the definitions below as guidance to assist in selecting the
   appropriate activity

    |image15|

    Construction – should be selected when the REM event occurred during
    a construction phase. The related CER Regulatory Instrument (order
    or certificate) number must been entered for construction
    activities.

    |image16|

    Operation – should be selected when the REM event occurred during
    the operational phase of a pipeline or facility.

    Maintenance - should be selected when the REM event occurred during
    the maintenance of a pipeline or facility. The related Operations
    and Maintenance (OM) notification event number must be entered for
    maintenance activities.

    |image17|

    Abandonment - should be selected when the event occurred during the
    abandonment of a pipeline or facility. The related CER Regulatory
    Instrument (Order or Certificate) number must be entered for
    abandonment activities.

    |image18|

4.8 Scenario
^^^^^^^^^^^^
  The scenario page allows the company to provide more information
  about the contamination being
| reported. For example, if the company is reporting a “NOC”, the
  circumstances page will allow the
| company to report what type of contamination occurred. The
  circumstances page will also trigger the
| system to require additional information based on the user’s input.

|image19|

|image20|

|image21|

***Key Things to Know About the Scenario Page***

1. | To describe the extent of contamination, provide brief details
     regarding the depth and spread of
   | contamination in the affected media, as delineated at the time of
     NOC submission.

   |image22|

2. Definition of a receptor: The person or organisms, including plants,
   potentially subjected to chemical exposure. If ‘terrestrial wildlife’
   is selected, there is no need to identify the minimum distance
   between the receptor and the contamination.

   |image23|

3. Potentially affected persons and communities notification and
   engagement ‐ Documents cannot be uploaded until the NOC is submitted.
   Upon submission of the NOC the functionality to upload a document
   will appear in the menu on the left hand side of the page. Attach
   documents immediately upon submission of NOC.

4. | If you have any questions or concerns relating to notifying
     Indigenous groups potentially
   | impacted by contamination, please discuss with the CER
     environmental analyst assigned to your
   | REM event. See the CER `Early Engagement
     Guide <http://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/bts/ctrg/gnnb/rlnggmntgd/index-eng.html>`__
     for further information on expectations related to engagement.

4.9 Actions Page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| The actions page allows the company to describe the actions taken to
  date to mitigate the impacts of
| contamination and planned remedial activities. The actions page will
  also trigger the system to require
| additional information based on the user’s input.\ |image24|

|image25|

***Key Things to Know About the Actions Page***

1. The planned actions to mitigate the impacts of contamination should
   include a brief description of planned next steps.

2. | If indicated that all substances have been cleaned up such that
     they meet the applicable criteria,
   | an email will be sent notifying you that a closure report must be
     uploaded in order to achieve
   | site closure, as outlined in the Remediation Process Guide.

3. If ‘yes’ is selected to the question ‘Is the contamination contained
   to company-owned property’ two additional questions will pop up. This
   question pertains to company owned or leased lands.

|image26|

    If the company indicates that the facility has an established
    groundwater and surface water monitoring program that is implemented
    and no free product is detected in groundwater wells, the CER may
    require no further submissions beyond the CCME classification
    worksheets and annual updates. The CER expects that accessible
    contamination will be remediated at facilities as specified in the
    company’s Environmental Protection Program.

1. | Note that company owned property does not apply to Right of Ways
     unless the company owns
   | the property on which the Right of Way lies\ **. If the
     contamination is confined to company
     owned property at the time of NOC submission but is later
     determined to have migrated off
     company owned property, an email must be sent to
     remediation@cer-rec.gc.ca notifying the
     CER of the off‐site migration. Similarly, if no free product has
     appeared in groundwater monitoring wells at the time of NOC
     submission, but is later detected in wells, the CER must
     be notified.

4.10 Screening Assessment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| The screening assessment page allows the company to provide additional
  information about the
| contamination in the situations where contamination has not been
  cleaned up at the time of NOC
| submission and contamination is not confined to company owned
  property. The responses should
| reflect the information available at the time of NOC submission.

The responses to the screening assessment questions will be used to
automatically assign a ‘low environmental risk’ status to certain
contaminated sites. If the responses to the screening assessment
questions indicate ‘low risk’, OERS will automatically send a request
for submission of a closure report. Upon review of the information
submitted in the NOC, the CER environmental analyst may determine that
further information is required prior to submission of a closure report.
In this case, the CER environmental analyst will request further
information through OERS.

For REM events that receive a medium or high risk site status, the REM
event will follow the regular procedure highlighted in Section 5.0 of
this document.\ |image27|

|image28|

4.11 Company Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This screen allows users to submit and attach a comment to the NOC. This
comment box provides an opportunity for additional comments, questions,
and concerns to be sent to the CER staff assigned to the NOC. The
commenter’s name and email address are required.

|image29|

4.12 Final Submission
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Once you have clicked the “Submit” button at the bottom of this page,
  CER staff will be notified; will review your information for
  completeness; and will either send you a message via email with the
  next action required or will contact you for more detailed
  information. The system will automatically assign the event a REM
  number, which will be used as a file reference.
| Note that your link to the data for this REM event will be disabled
  and you will no longer be able to make changes to this information
  after you click the Submit button.

***Key Things to Know About the Final Submission Page***

1. The next steps for managing the contaminated site may vary depending
   on how the questions were answered during the NOC submission. Some
   sites may require no further action except for an annual update,
   while others may require more in depth management. Other sites may
   immediately ask for a closure report following the final NOC
   submission.

2. After submitting the “Final Submission” you will receive a
   “confirmation of your submission” notification email with the
   contents of your report. The email will specify the next action
   required according to the Remediation Process Guide.

3. You will no longer be able to use the link provided to change the NOC
   submitted data. The link will now be used to manage the REM event and
   will only be active for contact changes, document uploads,
   Information Requests (IR), company notes, and submission extensions.
   If pertinent information was left out or if “Submit” was accidentally
   selected, please contact the CER at remediation@cer-rec.gc.ca.

The following section contains additional information about the follow
up required on NOCs.

5. REM Event Management
-----------------------

Upon review of the REM event, the CER environmental analyst will send an
email outlining the next submission required for this REM event. This
email will include a link that can be used for future communication (IR
responses) and for uploading documents. Use the link in the email to
enter the online portal to upload the report.

Upon re‐entering OERS following NOC submission, the menu on the left
hand side will include the following Table of Contents.

|image30|

of remediation report. The details about the report, attached documents,
and information request, including IR response, and reviews are located
on this page.

|image34|

**Note:** The report acceptance for RAPs differ from other report types.
When a RAP is accepted, the identified company contact/s will receive an
email with CER staff comments. For other types of reports, CER Staff
comments are viewed on the above page.

|image35|\ |image36|\ There is a list of documents that are attached to
each report type on the Status page. There are also details on this page
for the Information Requests for each report type. See the screenshot
below for the layout of the Status and Details page for a single report
type.

5.5 Reports – Submission Date Change
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Selecting the “Reports” under Remediation Reports will allow you to view
the types of reports required for the REM event. Clicking on the
specific report will bring you to a page that can be used to edit the
submission date of the document with a rationale for the submission date
change. You can also select ”Edit Submission Date” next to the report on
the Remediation Reports page to reach the same page. If you desire to
see the details, documents and information requests pertaining to a
specific report or to upload a document, select “Remediation Reports”,
and then “Status” or “Upload” beside the desired report.

|image37|

To submit a request to change the submission date dealine, enter the
propsed deadline date and explanation for requesting a deadline
extension, then select “Submit.” This will send an email to the CER
staff assigned to the REM event. The company contact/s will receive an
email when the CER staff accepts or rejects the submission deadline
change request.

|image38|

5.6 Information Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CER staff assigned to your REM event may issue an information
request to gain further understanding, clarification and information on
a report that was uploaded. The system will notify you via email when
additional information has been requested. All responses to information
requests must be entered through the system. The status of the
information request is located on this page. Information requests are
also viewable from the “Status” page in Remediation Reports. To provide
a response to an IR, select “Information Requests” from the tab menu and
then “Edit Response” beside the IR that you wish to respond to.

|image39|

The “Edit Response” link will take you to the below page where you will
submit the response to the IR from the environmental analyst. Please
enter the response and email address in the textbox below and click the
“Submit” button. Once submitted, the response can no longer be revised.

If the response to the information request includes a document, upload
the document through the “Upload Document” page and select which
Remediation Report Type and IR this response is addressing.

|image40|

|image41|

Once a CER environmental analyst has reviewed the IR, they have the
opportunity to provide comments in their review. An email is not sent
out for CER staff review comments, but these comments are viewable under
the Information Requests tab or the Status page on the Remediation
Reports tab. It is up to the discretion of CER staff to notify the
company regarding IR response acceptance. An additional IR may be issued
if initial IR conditions were not met.

5.7 Annual Updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Previous annual updates relating to the REM event will appear on this
page. No information can be edited for past annual updates.

An email request for the annual update will be send by the CER on 1
April. This email will contain a link to the page which lists all the
REM events that are active (i.e., not closed or misreported) for the
company that your email is the contact for (i.e., if your company has
more than one contact assigned to different REMs, all contacts will
receive the same list of annual updates). An annual update must be
submitted for every REM event for which the NOC was submitted prior to
31 December of the previous year, and are not yet closed.

You will be able to submit the annual update upon receiving the annual
update request email sent by the CER. The annual updates must be
submitted by 30 June. Reminder emails will be sent on the 15 June.

The following is an example of an annual update. These four questions
must be answered for each REM event separately. Select “Save”, when
wanting to save the progress for the annual update. Select “Submit,”
when you are ready to send the annual update to the CER. The annual
update cannot be changed once submitted.

|image42|

|image43|

***Key Things to Know About Annual Updates***

1. The site status needs to be updated annually. The below guidance
   should be used when assigning site statuses to REM events:

   |image44|

   Site assessment – Environmental Site Assessment in progress to
   determine next steps, prior to active remedial or risk management
   work

   Ongoing remediation – RAP has been submitted and/or or active
   remedial work is ongoing

   Post remediation monitoring – Active remedial work complete and
   groundwater or reclamation monitoring is in effect

   Risk managed – Risk Management Plan has been submitted and/or risk
   management is taking place

   Facility monitoring – Use this status at facilities on company owned
   or leased lands where there is a groundwater monitoring program in
   place as described in section 12.3 of the CER 2020 Remediation
   Process Guide.

2. Items that should be included in the summary of planned future
   remedial activities and submitted reports are as follows: the plans
   for the development of a remedial action plan (RAP), risk management
   plan (RMP) or closure report in the annual update), along with
   justification for the report being developed. The CER Environmental
   Analyst will consider this justification, along with the information
   submitted in the NOC, CCME worksheets, and any persons’ interest(s)
   in the site, when requesting a RAP, RMP or closure report. Refer to
   Appendix C of the CER 202 Remediation Process Guide for guidance on
   when a RAP is required.

    |image45|

5.8 Company Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This screen allows users to submit and attach a comment to the REM
event. This comment box provides an opportunity for additional comments,
questions, and concerns to be sent to the CER staff assigned to the NOC.
The commenter’s name and email address are required. Select “Submit,”
when you are ready to send the CER your comments. Select “Save,” when
you want to save your progress, but are not ready to send the automated
email. Note: CER Staff are still able to view Company Notes when
“saved,” but will not receive an email notification until it is
“Submitted.”

|image46|

5.9 Documents Page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Documents screen allows for the upload of documents relating to the
REM event including, photographs, reports, various types of
correspondence, etc.

Populate the mandatory fields and select document type from the drop
down menu.

You can select “Add” for each additional document, or you can click
“Next” when all documents have been uploaded.

Key Things to Know About the Documents Page:

1. The size limit for uploads is 50 MB. If you have a larger file than
that you may submit it in hardcopy or via digital media directly to the
CER Records and Mail department. When you do so please quote the REM
event number for the file.

2. You may upload as many documents as are required.

3. Once you have uploaded a document and you wish to delete it, you can
contact the CER via email to remediation@cer-rec.gc.ca

4. Do not upload documents that contain private or sensitive
information. You must submit any of these documents in hard-copy to the
CER Records and Mail department and indicate that you wish to submit
them under section 16.1 of the CER Act. As above, please include the REM
event number with the document.

|image47|

5.10 Site Closure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Site Closure is initiated by CER staff by requesting a “Closure Report”
through an email generated by the system. The workflow for this request
will be similar to other report types. The company contact may request a
deadline extension, view the report status, and upload a document
pertaining to the Closure Report under the Remediation Reports tab.

|image48|

Upon submission of a Closure Report and Declaration Letter, the CER
environmental analyst will review the closure report and if satisfied,
recommend site closure to the Director of the Environmental Protection
Team. Upon accepting the recommendation to close the site, the CER will
send via email a Remediation Closure Letter and Close the REM event in
OERS. The company will receive an automated email stating that the REM
event has been closed and will no longer be able to access the REM event
in OERS.
